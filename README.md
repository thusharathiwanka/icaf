## Project Description

The International Conference on Application Frameworks (ICAF) is presenting the academic conference organized by Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). We developed a conference management tool where users can present results, conduct workshops, submit research papers, publish blogs, register to the system and approve research papers and workshops. Research paper and workshop templates will be available for anyone to download. Users have to register to the system before using the above functionalities. In this conference, researchers will present their most recent results and implementations of several programming languages, such as Java, JavaScript, Python and PHP. The conference will take place at SLIIT premises. Mainly, four roles have access to this site; Admin, editor, reviewer, and the user. Users can register as a researcher, workshop presenter, or attendee.

#### NOTE‚ùó: This project is developed just for assignment purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node JS should be installed

### Running the project

- In the project directory, you can run below commands to install the dependencies and run the app:

  1. ### `cd backend && npm install` - install backend dependencies
  2. ### `cd frontend && npm install` - install frontend dependencies
  3. ### `cd backend && npm start` - start the backend server
  4. ### `cd frontend && npm start` - start the frontend

### Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the backend server.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the jest test runner. This will run all the tests inside the api/tests/ directory.
